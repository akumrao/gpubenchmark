# GPU Benchmark for Google Pixel Mobile GPUs

This project benchmarks the performance of mobile GPUs used in Google Pixel devices, specifically focusing on:

1. PowerVR by Imagination Technologies  
2. Mali by Arm

---

## Background

Google is transitioning from Arm's Mali GPUs to PowerVR GPUs from Imagination Technologies in their Tensor G5 system-on-chip (SoC) for the Pixel 10 series. This change marks a significant shift in GPU architecture and capabilities.

The new PowerVR D-Series DXT-48-1536 GPU is expected to deliver advanced features such as ray tracing and virtualization support, enhancing the graphical performance and efficiency of Pixel devices.

## Contribution by Tech Mahindra Team

The Tech Mahindra team collaborated with Google to benchmark the PowerVR GPU performance. The main contributions include:

1. Benchmarking the G ChipSet using OpenGL primitives and evaluating Vulkan 3D scenes and games performance.  
2. Developing an app to benchmark PDU (Processing Data Unit), TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), and DPU (Data Processing Unit).  
3. Assessing shader and game load performance using graphical primitives.  
4. Collecting detailed statistics during tests, including tuning clock frequencies and GPU memory usage for performance optimization.
5. Comparing Mali GPU performance on Raspberry Pi with various windowing systems: X11, Android SurfaceFlinger, Wayland, and Mesa Gear tools.  
6. Analysis of PowerVR GPUâ€™s tile-based rendering architecture and mailbox rendering mechanisms.
